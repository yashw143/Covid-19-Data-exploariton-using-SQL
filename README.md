Data Exploration using SQL

The Covid-19-Data-exploration-using-SQL project involved using various SQL 
skills to analyze and manipulate data related to the Covid-19 pandemic. This included performing joins, using CTEs and temporary tables, using window and aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types. Through these techniques, the projec
aimed to gain insights into the patterns and trends of Covid-19 data.

--Insights derived from the Data

-- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
--  Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country

---Total Cases VS Population
---Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid

--Countries with Highesgt Infection Rate compared to Population
--Countries Highest Death Count per Population

--Breaking things down by continent
--showing continents with the highest death count per population

-- Total Population vs Vaccinations
--Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine

---Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

-- Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
